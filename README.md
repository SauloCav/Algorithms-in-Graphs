# Algorithms in Graphs

In mathematics, graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices which are connected by edges.

Some algorithms were based on GeeksforGeeks articles: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
